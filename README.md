# freeRASP for Android

freeRASP for Android is a mobile in-app protection and security monitoring SDK. It aims to cover the main aspects of RASP (Runtime App Self Protection) and application shielding.

:loudspeaker: The official documentation has been moved to a new location. You can now find it [here](https://talsec.gitbook.io/freerasp). :loudspeaker:


# Overview

The freeRASP is available for Flutter, Cordova, Capacitor, React Native, Android, and iOS developers. We encourage community contributions, investigations of attack cases, joint data research, and other activities aiming to make better app security and app safety for end-users.

freeRASP SDK is designed to combat

* Reverse engineering attempts
* Re-publishing or tampering with the apps
* Running application in a compromised OS environment
* Malware, fraudsters, and cybercriminal activities

Key features are the detection and prevention of

* Root/Jailbreak (e.g., unc0ver, check1rain)
* Hooking framework (e.g., Frida, Shadow)
* Untrusted installation method
* App/Device (un)binding

Additional freeRASP features include low latency, easy integration and a weekly [Security Report](https://talsec.gitbook.io/freerasp/security-report) containing detailed information about detected incidents and potential threats, summarizing the state of your app security.

The commercial version provides a top-notch protection level, extra features, support and maintenance. One of the most valued commercial features is AppiCryptÂ® - App Integrity Cryptogram.

It allows easy to implement API protection and App Integrity verification on the backend to prevent API abuse:

* Bruteforce attacks
* Botnets
* Session-hijacking
* DDoS

It is a unified solution that works across all mobile platforms without dependency on external web services (i.e., without extra latency, an additional point of failure, and maintenance costs).
